# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name's Chris. I'm a computer science student at UCF (Go Knights!) and an aspiring software developer.
I have experience working with Python and C and am dabbling with web development on the side.
I hope that I can use what I'm learning to get started on working on some small side projects.
Thanks for visiting my page!
